## Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

To build software that is easy to maintain, understand, and modify, I focus on creating modular and reusable components. For instance, the CRUD Python module I developed in Project One served as a flexible bridge between the dashboard widgets and the database in Project Two. This modular design not only sped up development but also made it simpler to identify and fix issues since each part of the program had a clear responsibility. In the future, this CRUD module could be repurposed for other projects that require database operations, such as APIs or data management tools, providing a reliable foundation that can be adapted as needed.

## Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

When tackling a problem, I begin with careful analysis to fully understand the requirements and constraints. Once I grasp the challenge, I evaluate various possible solutions and select the one best suited to address the needs effectively. I then create test cases with clear success and failure criteria to ensure each part of the solution meets expectations. Throughout development, I use these tests to verify and refine the application, debugging where necessary. This systematic approach helped me meet Grazioso Salvare’s database and dashboard requirements, and it’s a method I plan to continue using for future projects to deliver dependable, high-quality software.

## The Role of Computer Scientists and Their Impact

Computer scientists identify problems, devise solutions, and validate their effectiveness through testing. This process is essential to producing functional, user-friendly software that meets client needs. Without this cycle of problem-solving and refinement, growth and improvement would not be possible. Creating modular software, in particular, benefits companies by offering components that can be easily updated or reused, saving time and resources. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this means their systems can adapt quickly to new demands, improving efficiency and overall business performance.
